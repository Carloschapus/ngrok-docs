# Configuring ngrok Dashboard Salesforce Single Sign-On (SSO) with OIDC using Salesforce

_Please note that the OIDC flow will be initiated from your Applications login page.(OIDC Service Provider flow is not supported)._

This guide will walk you through enabling Salesforce as an Identity Provider to allow single sign-on into your ngrok dashboard. This should not be confused with securing your ngrok edge to allow your application users to log in using Salesforce.

The requirements for completing this guide are:

- Administrative access to create new applications in Salesforce
- Admin access to edit your ngrok account settings
- An ngrok Enterprise account or an SSO/Account Governance license

Congratulations, you should now be configured properly to log into your ngrok account using Salesforce!

By default, your ngrok account will still allow users to log in with their existing credentials as well as through Salesforce ("Mixed Mode"). Once you verify that everything is working properly with your integration, you can enable "SSO Enforced" in the ngrok Dashboard which will require all new users to log in through Salesforce for their ngrok account.
